# Port that goFlow2 will listen on for NetFlow v9 (UDP)
GOFLOW2_PORT=2055

# InfluxDB output configuration (Vector will actually handle forwarding to InfluxDB, 
# so goflow2 simply writes to stdout or a file. If you want goflow2 to write 
# somewhere, configure here. For now, we let Vector pull directly from goflow2 UDP port.)
# (No Influx settings are needed here unless customizing goflow2's export.)
